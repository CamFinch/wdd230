                <p>Apple is a great example of White Space and Clean Design as they are
                    known for their simplicity. In the screenshot above you are able to 
                    clearly read all information and distunguish sepeartation. There is
                    no clutter to be found.

            <div class="about-2">
                <p>Chick-Fil-A's website is a good example for the rule of thirds as they align 
                    all the important and eye catching elemnts in thirds. They are not close together and
                    are evenly spread. If you were to use a grid the image of the sandwhich and the order buttons all
                    fall on the 4 points.

            </div>
            <div class="about-3">
                <p>Lowes does a good job showing repetion in the screenshot above as not only the spacing
                    has stayed even throughout, they repeat the color coordination in all for elements shown.
                    They split each title into a top and bottom and kept the two shades of blue the same for each
                    top and bottom on all 4. THe size of the logos on each side are also the same and are also
                    the same color.
